# Math Drill #

Currently, this is just an attempt to generate addition and multiplication table
drill sheets. The idea is to provide something which can be printed, and my kid
can use for learning. However, creating an interactive table for use on a tablet
or mobile phone could be nice too... so maybe later.


## Usage ##

Just clone or download the project, and open `drill-table.html` in a web
browser. Specify the range of numbers to be used in the table, and click
the button to create the table.

Printing the page will print only the table, not the generation form.


## Future Enhancements ##

Maybe in the future, if it's worthwhile, the generated table can be used
interactively. For example, a kid presses each table cell to see the correct
value.

The table generation could maybe be easier with some kind of click-and-pull
behavior to size the table.

For now, though, it suits my minimum needs.
